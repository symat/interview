# interview
From time to time I need to attend on Java interviews. Some time as interviewer, some times as candidate. This playground repository contains some popular interview programming exercises on java language. Each of these exercises are solvable in good code quality in a couple of hours, depending on complexity and the level of knowledge... 

I try to use only standard java utilities. Each exercise is a separate package, there is no dependency between packages, each of them works / implemented on its own. Always check the test first, it is the actual specification.

I try to produce clean code and not always looking for the most optimized solution, unless it is actually requested. Also I try to follow TDD during the implementation, producing meaningful test cases. You are free to use the code here, but I don't take any responsibility for it. I'm doing this only for practicing / fun :)
